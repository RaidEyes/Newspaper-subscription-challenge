## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I tried using the _Nesting CSS_ but unfortunately, it is still unstable as there were a lot of bugs in my code that affect other interraction (`:hover`, `animation`,...)
My advice is stick with the traditional CSS first. Only use _Nesting CSS_ when it is completed

### Continued development

I will continue working with `Javascript` **Project** as I'm getting more and more deep learning into the language.
